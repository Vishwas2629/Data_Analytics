# Data_Analytics
This project was designed as a part of academic requirements for my Master's degree for the module Data Analytics.
Credit card data analysis is aimed at finding patterns in credit card users by clustering based on their usage and determining the appropriate credit limit for a 
particular customer. The two approaches used for this project are K-Means Clustering and Classification using Decision Tree Analysis.
